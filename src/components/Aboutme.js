        My name is Gayathri. I am a computer science student and I chose this
        field because I have always loved it since my school days. I remember
        creating my first html page and realizing that this is what I would like
        to do. I enjoy programming and worked as a programmer a few years back.
        I chose this class because I wanted to learn more about web development
        and gain some experience. In my free time I enjoy reading books,
        particularly fiction.
